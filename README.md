# 8-bit computer

This is a collection of software that is going to be used in the creation of an
8-bit computer (OS, shell and some programs). The idea is to build most of it
from scratch, that means: assembler, C like programming language and a simulator
to do quick prototyping.

I wrote C like because normal C is to big to run on a 6502, at least if you want
to do complex things. It is going to be mostly an assembly language with C
constructors.
